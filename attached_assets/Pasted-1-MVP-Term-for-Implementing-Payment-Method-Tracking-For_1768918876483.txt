1. MVP Term for Implementing Payment Method Tracking

For an MVP, you want terminology that is simple, intuitive, and expandable later.

Recommended MVP Term

“Payment Method Tracking”
or (even simpler for MVP)
“Payment Records”

What it Means in MVP Scope

At minimum, this should track:

Payment Method (Cash / GCash / Card / Other)

Amount Paid

Date & Time

Order / Receipt Number

Payment Status (Paid / Partial / Unpaid)

Example MVP Labels (UI-friendly)

Payment Type

Payment Mode

Payment Method

👉 Best MVP choice:
Payment Method — universally understood and future-proof.

2. Preventing Missing or Lost Customer Items (MVP-Level Solutions)

This is a common laundry problem, so your app + process should work together.

A. Itemized Intake (MOST IMPORTANT)

At drop-off, record:

Number of items

Item categories (Shirt, Pants, Bedsheet, Towel, etc.)

Special items (Jackets, Delicates)

MVP Term:

Item Count

Item List

Example:

Shirts (5), Pants (3), Bedsheet (1)

✅ This alone prevents most disputes.

B. Claim Stub / Digital Receipt

Generate a receipt with:

Order ID

Item count

Customer name

Pickup date

MVP Term:

Claim Ticket

Order Receipt

Even better:

QR Code (optional, later)

SMS or printed receipt

C. Status Tracking per Order

Simple statuses help reduce confusion:

Received

Washing

Ready for Pickup

Released

MVP Term:

Order Status

This prevents:

Items being released to the wrong customer

Customers claiming items too early

D. Item Verification on Release

Before handing over items:

Staff confirms item count matches intake

Customer confirms count before leaving

MVP Term:

Item Verification

Release Confirmation

E. Optional MVP+ Safeguards (Still Simple)

If you want one step better than MVP:

Color-coded laundry tags per order

Order ID written on laundry bag

Separate basket per order

No tech required, but huge impact.
